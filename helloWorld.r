print("Hello World")
# To become familiar with R syntax I will write an example program, which takes input x+y where both x and y are integers
# + can be any of the + - / * following, additon, subtraction, division or mulitplication
# The program will then loop accepting new inputs constantly giving out the correct answer to the sum.
